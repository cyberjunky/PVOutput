PV Output for Android
===================================

PV Output for Android is a clean and easy app for getting a quick status overview of ones PV system.

Introduction
------------

For iOS a clean and easy app was already available. When I switched to a smarthone running Android I really missed a simple app to monitor the output of my PV system.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Android Build Tools v23.0.0
- Android Support Repository

Screenshots

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Current Status
---------------

The app can currently show the pvoutput energy generation data in a Live/Today, Daily and Monthly view for a single pvoutput.org system. Additional functionality can be added as long as it's meaningful to the majority of the targeted users and as long as it doesn't compromise on cleanliness and ease of use.
The code is not optimized and may not be compliant to standard naming conventions yet.
